    <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
    <p style="color:var(--text-secondary);">Updated: 1 December 2025</p>

    <p>SmikeBoost Digital LTD ("SmikeBoost", "we", "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to keep your sessions secure, personalise experiences, and understand how Nigerian customers use our platform. This policy explains what cookies we use, why we use them, and how you can manage preferences in line with the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR).</p>

    <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small text files placed on your browser when you visit our site or dashboard. They help us remember your device, deliver essential features, and improve performance.</p>

    <h2>Cookie Categories We Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Essential (required):</strong> Authentication tokens, CSRF protection, and load-balancing cookies that keep you logged in and allow wallet transactions. Lawful basis: contract performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics (optional):</strong> Privacy-friendly analytics (Matomo/GA4) that collect anonymised traffic insights so we can optimise Nigerian campaign pages. Lawful basis: consent.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing (optional):</strong> WhatsApp/Meta/Google remarketing pixels that show relevant promos to audiences in Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt. Lawful basis: consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Collect Consent</h2>
    <p>First-time visitors see our NDPR-focused cookie banner where you can accept essentials only, accept all cookies, or customise analytics/marketing toggles. We record your choice (with timestamp and version) inside your browser for 12 months. We will prompt you again whenever the policy changes.</p>

    <h2>Managing Cookies</h2>

    <h2>Third-Party Cookies & Retention</h2>
    <p>We may embed cookies from Flutterwave, Paystack, Meta, Google, or TikTok when you interact with payment forms or ads. These partners process data under their own policies; we only work with vendors that commit to NDPR-compliant safeguards. Essential cookies expire when you log out or after 30 days of inactivity. Optional cookies last between 6 and 12 months.</p>
