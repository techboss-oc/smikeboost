SmikeBoost Cron Setup Guide

What this cron does
- Checks provider status for processing orders and marks them completed or refunded
- Sends automatic emails for completed or canceled orders
- Logs activity to app/cron_debug.log

Recommended schedule
- Every 5 minutes

Linux (crontab)
1) Find PHP path: which php
2) Edit crontab: crontab -e
3) Add entry (adjust paths):
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/your-site/public/cron.php >/dev/null 2>&1

Environment
- Ensure ENVIRONMENT=production is set in the web server or shell if used

cPanel
1) cPanel → Cron Jobs
2) Common settings: Every 5 minutes
3) Command:
/usr/local/bin/php /home/username/public_html/cron.php >/dev/null 2>&1

Plesk
1) Tools & Settings → Scheduled Tasks → Add Task
2) Command:
php /var/www/vhosts/your-domain/httpdocs/cron.php
3) Schedule: Every 5 minutes

Troubleshooting
- Check app/cron_debug.log for HTTP status and responses
- Verify provider API credentials in Admin → Providers
- Confirm orders move to "processing" with a provider_order_id
- Ensure outgoing email SMTP settings are correct in Admin → Settings
Using cron-job.org (HTTP-based scheduler)
1) Create a free account at https://cron-job.org/
2) Add a new job and set the URL to your cron endpoint:
   - Example: https://yourdomain.com/cron.php
3) Method: GET (default) or POST (both work for this endpoint)
4) Schedule: Every 5 minutes (or per your preference)
5) Advanced options (optional):
   - Monitoring: enable status notifications
   - Request headers: you can add a simple header like X-Requested-By: cron-job.org
6) Save the job and run a Test Run to verify it executes correctly.

Notes for cron-job.org
- Ensure cron.php is publicly reachable over HTTPS.
- The script writes to app/cron_debug.log; check it after test runs for confirmation.
- Provider API credentials must be configured in Admin → Providers.
- Orders should have moved to "processing" with a provider_order_id to be eligible for status updates.
